(;FF[4]CA[UTF-8]GM[1]DT[2019-02-14]PC[OGS: https://online-go.com/game/16576942]PB[Cakedefender]PW[JakeCarroll]BR[21k]WR[18k]TM[1200]OT[5x30 byo-yomi]CP[online-go.com]RE[W+113.5]SZ[19]KM[0.5]RU[japanese]HA[2]AB[pd][dp]C[cakedefender\: So, what general mistakes led to me losing so badly? It seems like he allowed me to have a tiny bit of space in three corners, giving himself huge walls that allowed him to secure the entire rest of the board.
];W[pq];B[cd];W[qo];B[jd];W[fq];B[hq]C[swannod\: I think it's ok for black to focus on his own formation, i.e. C6 or D10
];W[jq]C[Cakedefender: howdy
];B[go];W[hr];B[dk];W[qf];B[qh];W[qj];B[of];W[rh];B[rg];W[qg];B[ri];W[qi];B[sh];W[ph];B[re];W[rf];B[sf];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pe];B[pf];W[rh];B[oe];W[sg];B[se];W[si];B[pg]C[swannod\: A wasted move. Something like simple like K10?
];W[ec];B[gc];W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[dd];W[bc];B[bd];W[cf];B[ed];W[fc];B[fd];W[gd];B[eb];W[fb];B[cb];W[ea];B[bb];W[hc];B[ib]C[swannod\: I would probably swallow the C14 and take the profit. If white runs it out you'll make points.
];W[ic];B[hd]C[swannod\: K17 seems simpler and you make points
];W[ge];B[id];W[jc]C[swannod\: Could have been avoided with black K17
];B[kc];W[jb];B[hb]C[swannod\: Looks like a misread
];W[gb];B[kb];W[ja];B[ka];W[cj]C[swannod\: Because black didn't try to swallow C14 sooner probably not much you can do
];B[ck];W[dj];B[ca]C[swannod\: This move makes no points
];W[da];B[ej];W[ei];B[ek];W[fi];B[bj];W[bi];B[ci];W[di];B[bh];W[ch];B[ai];W[ci];B[bk];W[fo];B[eo];W[fn];B[gp];W[fp];B[em];W[fm];B[er];W[fl];B[fk];W[en];B[dn];W[el];B[dm];W[dl];B[cl];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[ep];B[do];W[dr];B[ds];W[cs];B[fr];W[gr];B[bs];W[es];B[bq];W[br];B[aq];W[ar];B[fs];W[gs];B[ac]C[swannod\: Another loss of tempo - you don't need this move.
];W[jj];B[bp]C[swannod\: Too small

cakedefender\: Ok, so I should have just tried to make another move worth more than saving the two stones? Something like L14?
];W[gk]C[swannod\: White locks the door - at this point it will be very difficult for black to win

cakedefender\: Would me playing at g9 earlier have worked? I remember playing this game and thinking that he would stop that chain easily either way
];B[gj];W[hj];B[fj];W[gi];B[le];W[hi];B[qb];W[mh];B[mg];W[nh];B[if];W[hf];B[he];W[hg];B[jg];W[in];B[ng];W[nm];B[oh];W[oi];B[og];W[ig];B[jf];W[jh];B[rd];W[lh];B[lg];W[ef];B[bf];W[bg];B[ag];W[ah];B[ae];W[af];B[be];W[aj];B[ak];W[ai];B[ag];W[df];B[af];W[ff];B[kh];W[ki];B[kg];W[bm];B[cm];W[bn];B[bo];W[ao];B[cn];W[bl];B[io];W[al]C[Cakedefender: You've been going pretty sicko mode so far
];B[iq];W[jp];B[ip];W[jo];B[jn];W[hn];B[ho];W[gn];B[ko];W[kn];B[jm];W[kp];B[lo];W[km];B[kl];W[jl];B[ln];W[im];B[lm];W[ll];B[lp];W[lq];B[];W[]C[Cakedefender\: Good game man but I gotta go

swannod\: White just had a better sense for making points and a small edge on reading. Black gave white many, many free moves.
